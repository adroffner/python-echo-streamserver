#summary Echo StreamServer API Overview
#labels REST

= Introduction =

This is a Python client for the Echo StreamServer REST API. There are a few APIs, actually. See the [http://aboutecho.com/developers/index.html Echo Documentation] for details.

  * feeds - Feeds API
  * items - Items API
  * kvs   - Key-Value Store API
  * users - User API

Most API methods raise the echo.StreamServerError exception.
This indicates a server-side error, or malformed request.

= Details =

Each *Echo API* is a separate _module_ or _package_ to *import*. Every *API* has both a _function_ interface and a *client* _object_ interface. The _function_ interface uses a *default* account shared by everyone.
